              A large percentage of the population of the world have dietary restrictions. These could include vegetarians, vegans, medical restrictions, and religious restrictions. A common issue that these people face is simple: what can you eat, and where can you find it? It can be especially difficult to find restaurants to eat at that can cater to certain restrictions. The goal of this project is to provide a website that people with restrictions can use to find places and things to eat! Simple enough right? People should be able to create an account with the site and complete a profile that lists their restrictions and uses their general location. After completing a profile, the user can see restaurants and stores near them that meets their needs. Users will also have the option to add things to the site, like locations they can eat or shop, and items or meals sold that could meet someone's restrictions. This idea was originally from my Brother-In-Law, who suffers from Celiac Disease, which is a autoimmune disease that causes white blood cells to attack the lower intestines when eating gluten.
